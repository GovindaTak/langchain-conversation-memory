# langchain-conversation-memory
Hands-on implementation of various conversation chains and memory mechanisms in LangChain using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language). This project explores how to build contextual chatbots that retain memory across turns, compare different memory types, and apply them in real-world GenAI use cases.
